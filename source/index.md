# Welcome.

Hydrata is an online user-interface for surface water modelling.

It provides an environment to build, run, collaborate and publish surface water models.

The primary interface to your models is the web brower. There is:

* no software to install,
* no need for dedicated hardware

We believe this enables seamless, accurate collaboration.

Of course, working online isn't always appropriate. You are always free to download your data and models. You can
modify and run models locally on your machines then publish the updates online.

We use the ANUGA two-dimensional hydrodynamic model as the core computational engine. Using an open-source engine enables true 
collaboration across organisations, and between past and future modelling efforts. 

Once the project owner chooses an access policy, anyone permitted can access, update and run the model. This enables 
transparent, defensible and open verification of work to build trust and ensure models get better over time, 
not going out-of-date on a hard drive somewhere.
