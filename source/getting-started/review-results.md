# Review Results

As the model run finishes, the results will be loaded onto the map automatically. 

Click the `Results` tab ![](../_static/icon-results-tab.png). You should see three result datasets:

![](../_static/icon-red-x.png) will toggle the layer visibility.

![](../_static/icon-download.png) will download the layer.

![](../_static/icon-slider.png) will adjust the layer transparency.

![](../_static/icon-delete.png) will remove the layer from the map (a copy will still be stored on the server).

Three result maps are produced. 

## Depth Maximum
The maximum depth map clearly highlights the potential for ponding on the highway to the north, and the detention basin accepts a significant volume of water within its embankment.

## Velocity Maximum
The velocity mapping highlights where and how water moves through the catchment. Two small waterfalls can be identified in the south-east of the northern tributary.

## VelocityDepth Maximum
The integral of velocity and depth serves as a proxy for "flow". It shows the areas where scour is more likely.
