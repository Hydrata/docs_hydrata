# Define model boundaries

First, let's give our layers a more recognisable name.

Click on the text box for "Boundary 01" and give it your own name. In our example we use "Full Catchments".

Now we can define the model boundary. In our tutorial, we are only interested in the two central catchments, both flowing
to the north. So we will limit computation to within this region.

1. Click the pencil icon ![](../_static/icon-pencil.png) and wait for the boundary data to load.
2. In the boundary editor, click "Add New Feature" ![](../_static/icon-add-new-feature.png)
3. To draw the geometry, click "Draw Feature" ![](../_static/icon-pencil.png)
4. We can now draw the model boundary polygon in the map interface
5. When you are happy with the geometry, click "Save Changes"
