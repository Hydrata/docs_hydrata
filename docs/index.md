# Welcome to Hydrata

Hydrata is an online platform for surface water modelling.

It provides an environment to build, run, collaborate on, and publish surface water models — all from your web browser.

- **No software to install** — works in any modern browser
- **No dedicated hardware** — simulations run on cloud infrastructure
- **Seamless collaboration** — share models across organisations

## How it works

Hydrata uses the [ANUGA](https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core) two-dimensional hydrodynamic model as its core computational engine. Using an open-source engine enables true collaboration and reproducible results.

Once a project owner sets an access policy, anyone permitted can access, update, and run the model. This enables transparent, defensible, and open verification of work — building trust and ensuring models improve over time rather than going out-of-date on a hard drive.

## Working offline

You are always free to download your data and models. You can modify and run models locally on your own machines, then publish updates online. See the [ANUGA standalone guide](anuga/getting-started.md) for running simulations outside Hydrata.
