# Getting Started

This tutorial walks you through setting up and running the simplest possible model in Hydrata. By the end you will have:

1. Created a new project
2. Uploaded elevation data
3. Defined domain boundaries
4. Applied rainfall
5. Run a flood simulation

We recommend completing this tutorial before diving into the reference documentation for individual input types.

## What you'll need

Before starting, make sure you have the prerequisites listed on the next page. The minimum requirement is a GeoTIFF elevation raster — the other inputs can be drawn directly in the Hydrata interface.
